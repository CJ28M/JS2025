      <h2>Code Execution stages</h2>
      <span>-Parsing: Before code can run, it must first be parsed, or validated and prepared for execution. This is
        known as the parsing stage. A lot of detailed, low-level tasks are carried out during this
        process.</span><br><br>
      <span>-Execution: Once our code has been parsed, its syntax has been verified and the program is ready to run. The
        execution stage is when the actions are written into our program--- printing to the console, prompting the user
        for input, making calculations, etc --- are actually carried out.</span><br><br>

      <h2>JavaScript Errors</h2>
      <span>-Syntax Error: JavaScript can only execute a program if the program is syntactically correct. Syntax refers
        to the structure of a language (spoken, programming, or otherwise) and the rules about that structure. A syntax
        error is a violation of the formal rules for a given language.</span><br><br>
      <span>-Runtime Error: these errors indicate that something exceptional (and bad) has happened. Runtime errors
        occur
        during the execution phase of a program. They are only encounter after the syntax of the program is completely
        correct.</span><br><br>
      <span>-Logical Error: If there is a logic error in your program, it will run successfully and not generate any
        error messages. However, the program will not work as intended.</span><br><br>
